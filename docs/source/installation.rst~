Installation
============

Installation of TIDAL pipeline involves installing a set of softwares, downloading a set of annotation files, and updating the shells scripts to provide their locations.


Software Dependencies
---------------------
- fastq-dump (sra toolkit, tested with  v. 2.5.0 )
- Trimmomatics (v. 0.30)
- Bowtie (v. 1.0.0) and Bowtie2 (v. 2.1.0)
- BLAT (v. 35x1)
- FREEC (`Control-FREEC <http://bioinfo-out.curie.fr/projects/freec/>`_ v. 7.2, run freec with mapability tracks)
- bedtools suite (v. 2.17.0)
- awk and other basic unix tools are install
- Perl (64bit)

All sofatware version listed above show the version of the code used in the pipeline. The code has not been tested with other version of these tools, but we expect minimal version changes.

Annotation Files
----------------
Download *Drosophilia Melanogaster* reference genome and masked reference genome sequence (Release 6/dm6 build) from UCSC genome browser, and set up their Bowtie and Bowtie2 indices (Bowtie2 indices are needed only for reference genome sequence). We only considered the sequences for chr2R, chr2L, chr3R, chr3L, chrX, chrY, and chr4. Download the required `annotation files <https://github.com/laulabbrandeis/TIDAL/tree/master/annotation>`_, some of which are manually curated and others were retrieved from UCSC genome browser. These `files <https://github.com/laulabbrandeis/TIDAL/tree/master/annotation>`_ have been upload in github so that you get started quickly.

- repmasker_dm6_track.txt : Repeat masker track from UCSC genome browser
- fly_virus_structure_repbase.fa: Mamunally curated sequence from fly viruses, structural and repbase sequences.
- Tidalbase_Dmel_TE_classifications_2015.txt : Custom table for repbase to flybase lookup
- gem_mappability_dm6_100mer.mappability : Gem mappability file needed by FREEC. Thanks to Hangnoh Lee for creating this file for us.
- Tidalbase_transposon_sequence.fa : List of concensus transposon sequences (manually curate)
- refflat_dm6.txt : RefSeq annotation from UCSC genome browser (refflat format, table type all columns) 
- dm6.chr.len : tab delimite file with chromosome name and length
