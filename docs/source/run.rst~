Run
===
TIDAL can be run from both sra and fastq format, when library name and length is provided.


TIDAL from SRA
--------------
To run TIDAL on sra file, there are two you have to do two things:

1. Prepare a run file

Format of run file (tab delimited)
::

    Library_ID      SRR_Accession   Min_Library_Length
    S2R+    SRR497719       100
    OSS_C   SRR1185816      150
    OSC_E   SRR1185771      150

**The column header in the file is important*

2. Run TIDAL_from_sra.sh
::

    nohup /location_from_root/TIDAL/CODE/TIDAL_from_sra.sh run_file.txt &


TIDAL from fastq
----------------
To run TIDAL on fastq file, we need the library in fastq format and read length.
::

    nohup /location_from_root/TIDAL/CODE/TIDAL_from_fastq.sh file.fastq min_len &

Congratulations!!! You have managed to run TIDAL, hope you get exciting results!
