About TIDAL
-----------
TIDAL is pipeline built to identify Transposon Insertion and Depletion in flies. The pipeline uses shell scrips, PERL, C and a combination of other publicly available tools. TIDAL uses a split read approach to identify Transposon Insertion and Depletion sites, and addition steps are implemented to reduce false positives 

Features
--------
- Flexible (TIDAL can be run with SRA files, Paired End and Single End libraries)
- Annotation Rich (TIDAL outputs have detailed annotation)
- Increased Specificity (Less false positives in outputs)
- Coverage Ratio
